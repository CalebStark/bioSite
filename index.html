                <h2>Intro to Emily</h2>
                <p>Emily Stark is a mother of one and a wife. She is an energetic individual who loves to jump on her motorcycle and explore the world. When she can’t get on her motorcycle, she finds herself enthralled in the many books she possesses or sitting down with a ball of yarn, crocheting her next project. Her love for these hobbies pales in comparison to the love she has for her son and husband. She spends what time she can with both of them, but working a full-time job in a warehouse can make that difficult at times. Still, Emily tries every day to share her passions with her family while taking in the passions her son and husband find and supporting them. 
                    Emily’s childhood had many struggles, but her community was strong, and because of that community, she was able to grow up to be a powerful, capable woman who’s goal is to raise a loving and caring family while also trying to help others whenever possible. Emily does not want to complicate life with a fancy job title or stressful work environment, leaving her satisfied with her current work-life balance. She wishes with all her heart she could spend every day with her son and husband but knows that not only is that not plausible at the moment, but they would also drive her a bit crazy. 
                    “At the end of the day, we can choose to enjoy what we have and look forward or can sulk about what we don’t have and look back; I choose to look forward and enjoy every moment I have and appreciate what has been given.” – Emily Stark.
