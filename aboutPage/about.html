                    <h2>Emily Stark childhood</h2>
                    <p>Emily Stark was born and raised in Sioux City, Iowa. She spent her life up to the age of 18 only knowing Sioux City as home. She was raised by her Mom Christina and Dad Joe.
                         Her family was notl off and the fact that they already had 2 older children there were a few struggles that her and her family had to work thru. To add on to the 
                         financial burden when Emily was eleven her mother was in a bad moter vehical accident brought on by a series medical condition. With this accident her Mom was feet away from driving 
                         into the missouri river. If she had ended up in the river it is very likely Emily would have grown up without her Mom. Fortunately that was not the case but there was still a long 
                         recovery on the way for her mother. During this time Emily stepped up as a few years prior her Mom had twins leading to Emily becoming the middle child with a 17 year age gap between 
                         her oldest sibling and youngest sibling. During the recovery period Emily steeped up to help take care of her younger siblings along with many people between her church and family.

                         As Emily got older and started getting into highschool she participated in debate, choir, and ROTC. She wanted to follow her older brothers footsteps and join the military when she 
                         finished highschool so what better way to prepare for that then to be part of the local ROTC. She learned a lot from that group but when it came to getting into the military, specically
                         trying to become a pilot in the air force she was disqualified due to color blindness. That was a large hit to her moral and ambitions of joining the military ultimately leading to her 
                         choosing not to join but instead go to college and attempt to become a teacher. At the same time she began to look to the future and the possibility of building a family.

                    <h2>Creating a Family</h2>
                    <p>Emily met her husband in twenty seventeen summer prior to senior year of highschool at a friends bonfire. She was not in process of trying to start a relationship at the time but 
                        more fell into one. Seeing the guys smile and kinda odd way that he caried himself she became intrigued and had to get to know him. She messaged there mutual friend the next day and 
                        was able to get a way to reach out a talk with that guy. It turned out he was intrigued by Emily as well as so they set up a date and got some dinner that next evening. At first there 
                        was just a lot of texting and getting to know each other as is pretty normal in a relationship but quickly that shifted from talking to exploring each others hobbies. Emily tried out 
                        playing some of the games he enjoyed and he started to learn how to play D&D. From there on the relationship grew and changed over time to something that felt more permanent and secure then 
                        past relationships. The big stepping stone for Emily was when she finally introduced him to her family. Emily was scared of that introduction because she knew that her family could be a a lot
                        to digest and didin't want to scare this guy off. But instead of scaring him off they became even closer learning that her family actually really liked this guy with even her Dad approving of him.

                        <br>
                        A year latter they ended up moving out of Sioux City together to move to Cedar Falls IA, a four hour drive from Sioux City. This was the first time either of them had been away from Sioux City 
                        and family so it took some time to adjust to living out on there own but they adapted and Emily started school at the University of Norther Iowa. After the first year Emily decided school was 
                        not the path that was right for her so she dropped from that program and shortly after dropping from those classes in late summer of 2019 she got married to her loving husband Caleb. At this 
                        point Emily wanted kids but knew it was not the right time to have them so Emily and Caleb waited to attempt to have kids until 2021. In mid to late 2021 they decided it was time to try as Emily 
                        wanted a large family with multiple kids. It took nearly nine months to get pregnant but once pregnant things had just began. The pregnancy was hard on Emily and by the end of it was life threatening
                        but the results of the pregnancy were worth every moment of it. January 2023 her son was born and over the course of time up until the day I am creating this biography she says that there is 
                        nothing quite like being a Mom.

                    <h2>Finding Activities to love</h2>
                    <p>Emily's activities in highschool really did not transition with her into adult life leaving her in a position where she really had to find her own passions and people to interact with out in the 
                        world. This is what she loves about motorcycles and her love of crocheting and books flourished during the pandemic when everyone was trapped inside.
